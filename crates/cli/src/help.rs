/// Observes a Mac's CPU, memory, disk, network and energy, read-only.

/// Runs on macOS only, on arm64 and x86_64. Run `hostvitals doctor` first to see which measurements can be read here. Every command only reads; none changes anything. The commands themselves show what can be observed, so there is no separate dry-run mode.
///
/// Never runs `sudo` itself, installs anything or prompts. A measurement needing root is listed as `skipped`, with the line that takes it; the caller decides whether to run that line. No daemon, saved history or cache: each invocation observes one window and exits.
///
/// Commands answer exactly one JSON object on stdout. A refusal is `{"error":"reason; fix command"}` with a nonzero exit code. Missing or skipped capabilities are expected answers and exit zero. Warnings go to stderr. Exceptions: `--help`, `-h`, and `help` answer Markdown; `--version` answers a version line.

    /// Run this first, after a macOS update, or when a measurement is unavailable. Reads the Apple CLIs below with bounded, noninteractive probes. Process probes target this invocation, never an arbitrary process. Native reads check the observer's task information and cumulative counters, an actual IOReport Energy Model subscription and sample, and its responsible App. No report files are saved. The probes are independent checks, not one simultaneous resource measurement.
    ///
    /// Answers `{"source":"host","host":{"macos_version":"27.0.1","arch":"arm64","is_root":false},"checks":[...]}`. `source` is `fixtures` only when the explicit testing environment `HOSTVITALS_PROBE_FIXTURES` supplies native observations. `host.macos_version` is the product version; `arch` is the binary's arm64 or x86_64 architecture; `is_root` describes its effective user.
    ///
    /// Each check has `name`, `kind` (`cli` or `direct`), and `status` (`available`, `unavailable`, or `skipped`). An unavailable or skipped check also has `reason` and `fix`, a command to retry or enable the read; `guidance`, when present, explains an interface change. A missing executable uses a PATH repair. A CLI failure includes its exit status and bounded stderr. A probe is stopped after {const:PROBE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS} seconds. Private interfaces can change: they are reported unavailable, never substituted with invented readings. An unavailable private interface may need a newer hostvitals; root does not repair a missing interface.
    ///
    /// Available direct checks also have `data`. `rusage`: `resident_bytes` (RAM), `footprint_bytes` (charged memory), `peak_footprint_bytes` (lifetime peak), `read_bytes` and `written_bytes` (cumulative disk I/O), and `energy_nj` (cumulative energy in nanojoules), for this process. `libproc`: `pid`, `resident_bytes`, and `threads` for this process. `ioreport`: `energy_channels` discovered and `sampled_channels` actually read, both channel counts, not watts. `responsibility`: this process's `pid` and responsible `app_pid`; a process with no other responsible process is its own App.
    ///
    /// Root-only probes are skipped without executing them. To take those reads, run `sudo hostvitals doctor` yourself. It never asks for credentials. If a CLI probe is denied, run its check again as root yourself; if the interface is unavailable on this macOS version, retry after updating hostvitals. All findings are returned together with exit zero; only an invalid invocation or unreadable host identity refuses the command.
